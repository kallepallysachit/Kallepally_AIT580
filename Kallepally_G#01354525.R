#TASK 1.a.
#URL OF THE NEWS PAGE: https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522 

The data visualization in the above URL shows the cities with the great bowling averages. The example has 
the unneessary details in it. The top cities with the highest wickets has nothing to do with the teams that 
will win the world cup. This is the problem in the data visualization in the the above URL. Instead of presenting
the wickets taken by the cities, it can be represented in a better way by showing the wickets taken by the bowlers
in each team. Hence this is the problem in the visualization and this is how it can be solves in a better way.


#TASK 1.b.
#URL OF THE NEWS PAGE: https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522

The ESPN cricinfo has published an article on which cricket city will win the world cup in the year 2019.
The data visualization present in the above URL represents the cricket places which has the best batting averages.
It’s difficult to pick up any meaning from the data by looking at the graphics in the data. To get an insight into 
what this visualization is all about, you’ll have to read the written texts before the graphics and the ones
associated with it. The colour combinaton is also wrong in the visualization as it is not friendly to the eyes.
You cannot categorize this visualization to any visual data visualization type. The closest it gets is to a bar chart, 
but instead of bars, the designer used different shapes representing each city. Hence, this this the example of
distortion and unneccessary detail in the visualization and this is the solution.
